# Week 05  
**Date:** 24th Dec – 30th Dec, 2025

## Topics Studied

### CKB Economics Glossary  
- Completed the **CKB Economics Glossary** to understand how Nervos aligns security, storage, and incentives.
- Studied **Base Issuance** and **Base Reward**, learning how CKBytes are issued with a fixed, halving schedule (total supply capped at 33.6B) to incentivize miners and secure the network.
- Learned about **Secondary Issuance** and **Secondary Rewards**, which introduce targeted inflation (1.344B CKBytes/year) to pay miners for long-term storage and computation, while allowing DAO stakers to remain inflation-neutral.
- Understood miner incentive mechanisms including **Proposal Rewards**, **Commit Rewards**, and **Transaction Fees**, and how they contribute to transaction confirmation and network security.
- Explored economic challenges such as the **Heavy Asset Problem**, **Starving Layer 1 Problem**, and various forms of the **Tragedy of the Commons**, and how Nervos addresses them through its crypto-economic design.
- Learned concepts like **State Rent**, **Economic Abstraction**, **Store of Assets**, **Store of Value**, **Tail Emission**, and **Targeted Inflation**, and how they support sustainable long-term blockchain security.
- Also started the **CKB basic practical operation** course!
